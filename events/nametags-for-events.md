Make nametags by organizing a spreadsheet of all attendees, title and organization. Upload that spreadsheet to Avery Design & Print Online, choose print it yourself and use template 5392, then follow directions to upload your spreadsheet. After you design the nametags, you can print to a pdf, which can then be printed on the nametag papers via any printer.
