Invitation to INN Workshop For News Leaders, Chicago, September 2016

I’m writing to make sure you saw the announcement for INN’s workshop on Technology and Product Design For News Leaders in Chicago on September 28th and 29th, and extend a personal invitation for you to register and join us.

This is a free workshop for INN members, geared toward executive directors, editors, and newsroom leaders. Columbia College is providing space for the workshop, which happily coincides with the LION Summit September 29th through October 1st.

We’re also pleased to offer travel support to INN member organizations. Thanks to generous support of the Mozilla Foundation, INN can reimburse up to $500 in travel costs for up to 20 INN members, based on need. (You can apply here.)

We have a fantastic lineup of guest speakers and sessions, including:

- How to go beyond telling great stories and turn your work into a sustainable business.
- Planning and budgeting for tech projects. Tools and techniques to eliminate the guesswork. 
- Beyond pageviews: Getting the most out of analytics and impact tracking.
- Recruiting and managing technical staff. 
- Planning and executing successful data projects.
- How to bring design thinking into your organization without breaking the bank.
- And more…

All attendees of the INN workshop are also invited to the LION opening reception at Film Row Cinema, 8th floor, 1104 S. Wabash, just off South Michigan Avenue in the South Loop.
