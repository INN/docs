We’re writing to let you know that your travel reimbursement application for the INN Technology and Product Design For News Leaders workshop has been approved. We’re very happy to provide this support, with thanks to the generosity of the Knight-Mozilla Open News. We’re looking forward to your participation in this event.

We’ve set up a Slack channel for the workshop at https://innorg.slack.com/. If you’re on Slack just send a note to nerds@inn.org and we’ll add you to the channel. We’ll be using Slack for sharing info not only about sessions but also crucial things like coffee and happy hour locations, so you might not want to miss that.

**Expense Items Needed and Timeline**

After the workshop, we’ll need you to send a few things to laura@inn.org so we can process your travel support check:

- Completed INN expense form (attached) or Expensify/similar report
- Copies/scans of all receipts
- Address where you want the check sent

Please note:

- Checks will be sent by late October or soon after your form and receipts are received. Please try to get them in as early as possible!
- We can support expenses up to $500 including transportation (airfare, taxis, car rental, uber, etc), hotel and meals.  

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch. We look forward to seeing you in Chicago!
