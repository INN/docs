## Propose a Lightning Talk for the INN Workshop on Technology and Product Design For News Leaders

We want your proposal for a five minute talk to share something you’re passionate and excited about. 

There’s no requirement for these to be tech related; could be about projects at your organization, side projects or other interests you have to share.

There is, however, a strict five minute limit so practice your talk ahead of time and make sure you pick a topic that works well within this time constraint.

Here are some great resources on the nature of lightning talks and how to give them:

- Tips on giving Lightning Talks: http://www.perl.com/pub/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html

Note that we'll have a projector and a single shared laptop available for presentations. If you don't need it for your talk that's great, but if you do want to use slides please be prepared to send us your presentation in advance.

We'll review all proposals submitted and let people know by September 21st to confirm the lineup.

## What's the title of your talk?

## Give us a short description for the program with a bit more detail on what you're planning to talk about.

## What's your email address? We'll use this to get back to you about the lightning talks.
