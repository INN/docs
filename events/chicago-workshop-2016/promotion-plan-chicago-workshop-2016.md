# Chicago Workshop Promotion

## What’s been done
- Announcement published twice in the INN Nerd Alert newsletter (600 subscribers)
- Individual email invitations sent to people on this list
- Jason promoted on Social Media (Facebook, Twitter)
- Weekly promo in the main INN newsletter (~1,800)

## Next Steps (with details on who’s doing what)
- Email out on Thursday to MailChimp list (Jason will prepare)
- Invite copy for Sue (Jason will suggest/Sue will send to her people)
- Message the INN listserv (again?) in conjunction with the MailChimp campaign (Laura)
- Ask Mel Kramer to promote via Poynter (Jack) - DONE
- Find out which INN members are attending LION and make sure they get notified (Jack) (by Thursday; confer with Jason about names on the list)
- Ask Sue about holding tickets for INN or LION (Laura)
- Promote event on the Slack/Open Tech channel (Jack)
- Promote via MediaShift next week (Jason)
- Will suggest edits to the Eventbright page (Jason)

## Other possible promo channels
- Hacks/Hackers Chicago (Jason will look into) ← This is defunct. Andy Boyle was one of the admins and would be someone else to ask about invitee suggestions

## Brainstorm
- Standalone email announcement?
- Content marketing (Q&A with trainers, etc)?
- Which URL are we promoting? The event page or the blog post? (How about the Eventbright page)
- Can we craft a way for executives to brag about going to this without sounding like they’ve been inept at technology all this time?

**Ask to promote (need contacts at these places):**
- Speakers
- IRE
- ONA
- Poynter
- CJR
- Nieman Lab
- Current
- Foundations? Sue will want to handle
- MediaShift
- MediaBistro
- Are there tech communities we can reach out to? Under the message “Help your boss become more literate, better at managing you.
- Our sponsors:
- Mozilla Foundation
- College of Media and Innovation, Columbia College Chicago
- Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation
- LION Publishers (conference partner)

Laura,

ONA
IRE

Sharing with you our press release distrib list that has CJR, Neiman, etc.

Would repeat it to LION.

Speed is of the essence at this point so the sooner we get it out the better. Thanks --

Sue

## Questions:

What’s up with limited seats for LION, INN members, etc?
