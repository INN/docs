# Thank-you email to attendees after the event

Subject line: Thanks for attending INN Technology and Product Design For News Leaders!

On behalf of the INN team, I want to thank you for participating in the 2016 INN Technology and Product Design For News Leaders workshop. It was such a pleasure to get to know you better, and to interact while exploring some of the key issues we’re working on to increase our impact and the success of our organizations. We hope you found the two days more than a little worthwhile, with some takeaways you can put to use going forward. 

Your feedback is crucial to understanding how we did with this event, and to plan even better workshops in the future. While things are fresh, we’d be very grateful if you would complete this quick evaluation:

It’s also important for us to say thanks to some people who made this workshop possible:

And of course you! Thank-you for your contributions to this event, and for your continued work on behalf of your constituents and the community of nonprofit news. 

All the best,
