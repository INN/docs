**What is not (and will not) be in here:**

-  Documentation for [Largo](http://largoproject.org) and some of our other large projects which will typically be kept with their respective project repos as well as on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
-  Documentation for our other apps/tools/etc. (e.g. our [deployment tools](https://github.com/INN/deploy-tools) or our [responsive tables](https://github.com/INN/responsive-tables) rig) that are on the smaller side will typically reside within those repos directly as a readme file at the root of the repository.

**Important Note:** Nothing in these docs supercedes what you'll find in the [INN employee manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MkXPsg6nD3yAfwXWczhscdoze7QhHgsrd_vLK1uQPB4/edit). Always refer to that for any personnel, hiring, payroll, etc. issues.
