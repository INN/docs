# Contributing

We welcome contributions and suggestions to help us improve any of these documents. Please start by [reading our contribution guidelines](/how-to-work-with-us/contributing.md).

### Workflow:

1.  [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2.  Create a branch (`git checkout -b my-branch`)
3.  Stage and commit your changes (`git commit -am 'description of my changes'`)
4.  Push the changes to your fork (`git push origin my-branch`)
5.  [Submit a pull request to the parent repo](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Please read our [guide to submitting pull requests](/how-to-work-with-us/pull-requests.md) to see what we expect in a good pull request message.
6.  Pull request should be assigned to:
    - [@aschweigert](http://github.com/aschweigert) (primary)
    - [@kaeti](http://github.com/kaeti) or [@rnagle](http://github.com/rnagle) (secondary)

We have [a helpful how-to](/how-to-work-with-us/via-github.md) that walks through this process in more detail if you're new to using Git.

Additionally, you can [create issues](https://github.com/INN/docs/issues) on this repo to suggest changes or improvements.

And of course you can always email us: [nerds@inn.org](mailto:nerds@inn.org).

### Standards

- Use [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for all documents
- Follow all INN documentation standards
- If your pull request changes a file's name or the location of a file within the repository, please check all other files in the repository for links to the former filename. (`git grep "old-filename-here.md"`)
