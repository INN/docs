#News Applications Developer (WordPress Focus)#

This position is full-time with competitive salary and benefits.

Founded in 2009, the Investigative News Network has grown into a network of 92 nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest news organizations. We provide training, support and shared services to member organizations to help them become sustainable businesses.

In 2012, INN began development of a hosted WordPress platform for member organizations called [Project Largo](http://largoproject.org) that is now used by over 20 INN members and is available as an open source framework for non-members. To support the ongoing growth of this platform we are expanding our technology team and are looking for a full-time web/application developer.

In this position, you will take ownership of new features and constantly improve the core Largo platform while also helping individual publishers with site setup and migration, feature requests, theme customization and special projects. You may also, from time to time work directly on projects with members and/or as a consultant with non-member sites who wish to implement the open source version of our framework.

In addition, you’ll have the opportunity to contribute to other INN projects and have input in our overall technology strategy. We’re a small shop and we want to hear your ideas for how technology can help nonprofit news organizations succeed.

The ideal candidate will have previous experience working in a news environment (or on large content sites) and be a hard-working, curious, self-starter who is comfortable working independently with little supervision but also able to take feedback and work collaboratively with our staff and members as required.

The person we hire would ideally be located in, around or willing to relocate to Columbus, Ohio (preferred) or optionally INN’s home office in Los Angeles, CA. Working remotely is a possibility for the right candidate. If that’s you, then we would strongly prefer that you have previous experience working as part of a remote team.

We work hard and love what we do but we also offer a flexible (and fun) work environment, competitive salary and benefits, a budget for the hardware and software you need to do your job and we are committed to your professional growth.

**Requirements:**

-  3-5+ years professional experience in web/mobile development, deployment and support, college degree in computer science or another relevant field preferred (but not required)
-  Strong front-end skills (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript). Experience with CSS pre-compilers and front-end frameworks such as LESS/SASS, jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, Bootstrap, etc.
-  Strong design sensibility with a focus on end-user experience; experience with responsive design
-  Expert knowledge of the full LAMP stack with a particular focus on PHP and MySQL
-  Experience developing for WordPress including themes, plugins and experience with WordPress multisite
-  Experience with version control (we use git) and deployment tools
-  Experience configuring hosting environments; testing, optimizing and scaling high-volume websites and applications

**Preferred:**

-  Previous experience developing websites/apps in a news environment, ideally working with and scaling large, complex CMS deployments (WordPress in particular) at an enterprise level
-  Knowledge of one or more other back-end languages/frameworks (Python/Django, Ruby/Rails, etc.)
-  WordPress core contributor and/or active involvement in the WordPress developer community
-  Experience working with social APIs, mapping, data visualization tools, etc. will occasionally be helpful but you’d also have an opportunity to learn these on the job
-  Experience writing documentation and explaining technical concepts to non-technical users. This is not a key component of this job but you will, from time to time, interact with non-technically trained members directly.

To apply, please send the following to INN Director of Technology Adam Schweigert at [adam@investigativenewsnetwork.org](mailto:adam@investigativenewsnetwork.org):

-  Resume/CV
-  Brief cover letter explaining why you’re excited to use your mad technical skills to help nonprofit journalism save the world.
-  Links to recent work you’re proud of (include a short description of the role you played in each project, links to github repos, etc.)
-  Salary requirements (ballpark is fine)
