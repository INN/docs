## Inndy

At the end of every Nerd Alert newsletter's list of **Hot Links**, there's a link from someone named "Inndy".

Inndy started out as Bert, [our clone](https://github.com/inn/hubot) of Github's Hubot for Hipchat. Bert's `beedogs` and `beer me` were popular commands. 

We included Bert in the newsletter from the [beginning](https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=81670c9d1b5fbeba1c29f2865&id=d6cabf04b3&e=0f64c62899), because Bert was a valued member of the team.

From [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/aschweig/status/969651574610870272):

> Ben: Is this history of Inndy/Bert in the Nerd Alert newsletter correct? https://github.com/INN/docs/commit/c214096c05291cb20dc3e6fe0cbb7b018fb0443c

> Adam: hmm, i'm pretty sure bert was in the newsletter from the beginning and was \*always\* supposed to be robot-related because we thought it was funny   
> Adam: like he/she/it (we never figured out bert's pronouns definitively afaik) was a valued member of the team and we didn't want to exclude him/her/them just for being a robot
> 
> Kaeti: Ya, I think the idea was to treat Bert/Inndy as a full teammade who would share robot perspectives.
> 
> Adam: hot robot takes
> 
> Kaeti: bot takes dot biz

Thus.
