Hi there,

The INN News Apps and Technology team sends out a weekly newsletter every Friday called "Nerd Alert" where we share the best things we've read each week.

Each week we seek a guest contributor to share something that caught their attention that week and we'd love to have you be our "guest star" this week.

All we need is:

- Your name as you want it to appear in the newsletter
- Your title/organization (where applicable) or a few words about what you do
- Twitter handle, if you want us to include it
- A link to the best thing you read this week and a couple sentences on what it is, why it grabbed your attention and why you think other people should read it
- Optional: a photo (doesn't need to be very big, square is best)

You can see examples of past guest contributions at https://nerds.inn.org/tag/guest

We would need your contribution by Thursday, [DATE] at 3 pm CT.

Please let us know at nerds@inn.org as soon as possible if you're interested and able to contribute. We're excited to hear from you!

Best,
The INN Nerds
