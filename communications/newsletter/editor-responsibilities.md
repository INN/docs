# Editor Responsibilities

Like all of our recurring programs, we take turns editing our newsletter each month. Here's what the editor for that month is responsible for:

- Managing the creation, publication and archiving of that month's newsletters
- Growing our subscriber list

And then for each newsletter:

- [ ] Reach out to potential guest contributors by EOD Monday each week. Request that they submit their content by Thursday for inclusion in Friday's newsletter

- [ ] Ensure all newsletter content is delivered and in the draft Google doc by end of day Thursday

- [ ] Have all newsletter content moved over to MailChimp and ready for edit by 12 p.m. CT on Friday

- [ ] Complete all of the tasks in the [pre-publish checklist](/checklists/newsletter.md)

- [ ] Add newsletter content to the blog as a draft (reference the [blog post checklist](/checklists/blog-post.md) for more details)
	- [ ] if the post has a guest contributor, tag it 'guest'
	- [ ] put it in the "Newsletter" category

- [ ] Newsletter sent via MailChimp by 2 p.m. CT on Friday

- [ ] Publish newsletter post on the blog after the email is sent

- [ ] Share newsletter blog link on social platforms
