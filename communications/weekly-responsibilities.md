### Rotating Tasks in Asana:

The actual rotation of weekly responsibilities is managed in Asana in the 'Weekly Responsibilities' project (restricted access) with recurring tasks.

The Asana board currently maintains a matrix of 4 tasks (above) by 5 teammates. This means that very week, one person gets a free pass. (This can and will change depending on new hires, etc.)

Once a task is closed, a new task is automatically created for the person it's assigned to. This new task is assigned for the Monday 5 weeks from the task's original due date. Everyone's allowed to change the due date to accomodate the requirements of the task and their individual priorities. This will not effect the date that new tasks are automatically assigned to.

### Adding/Removing a Person from the Rotation:

If a person were to be added today, then another free pass is added.
If a person is removed, then we remove the free pass.

If more than 1 person were removed then the team should double up on responsibilities.

(It's a delicate balance.)
