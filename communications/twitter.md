# Twitter

- Login credentials for all of the organization Twitter accounts are in the shared 1password vault in the INN dropbox.
- You might find either [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com) (login using the main [@INN](http://twitter.com/inn) Twitter account) or [Tweetdeck](http://tweetdeck.com) helpful for scheduling tweets and monitoring conversations.


### Accounts Our Team Manages

The responsibility for managing the team accounts rotates month to month (see the [team editorial calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJ2LAfQRzbDpxDfhpwfJo_a4DFM5-T4GDzRpj2t6qvk/edit))

**[@INNnerds](http://twitter.com/innnerds)** is our main team account. This account should tweet:

- All new posts [on the team blog](http://nerds.inn.org) (typically 2-3 times per post at different times of day and days of the week to catch different audiences, try to not tweet exactly the same thing each time, pick a quote from the post or some other interesting tidbit to mix things up)
- Product updates/announcements. Sometimes we'll make small updates that won't warrant a blog post, we should use this account to get the word out.
- Tweet/retweet member organizations (apps teams and individuals) when they do cool stuff 
- Promote jobs at member organizations by either retweeting them or linking to the posting. Use the #INNjobs hashtag to collect these listings in one place and also remember to add relevant jobs as you find them to the next Friday newsletter.
- And finally, post things of general interest to technologists at member organizations (particularly) and the journalism and tech community at large
 
**[@LargoProject](http://twitter.com/largoproject)** is used for project updates for [Largo](http://largoproject.org). Typically we'll just use this to announce product updates and the launch of new sites. In the future we might have sufficient resources to use this to promote interesting things sites are doing with Largo or to support their work more generally.

**[@NewsNerdBooks](http://twitter.com/newsnerdbooks)** is the Twitter account for our [monthly book club](/projects/book-club) and is managed by whoever is responsible for leading the book club meeting that month. Typically we'll use it to announce the book selection for that month, perhaps post some teases and discussion questions throughout the month and then post several times the week of the monthly hangout to remind people to attend.


### Other INN Accounts

**[@INN](http://twitter.com/INN)** is the main organization account. If you have an announcement you want this account to post, @mention INN in your tweet and/or email [news@inn.org](mailto:news@inn.org)

### Voice and Tone for Organizational Accounts

- As with all of our public-facing communications, social media posts to organizational accounts should be professional and reflect well on the organization
- More specifically, they should reflect our mission to support and promote the work of our member organizations (and of course, our own good work!)
- A little levity and humor is ok but making jokes at the expense of others, being overly snarky, etc. is not. 

### Individual Accounts

We do not have a formal policy regarding personal use of social media but here are a couple general guidelines:

- If it is at all vague, be clear that you are speaking as yourself and that your opinions do not represent those of your employer
- Use common sense and try not to do anything stupid that would be likely to reflect poorly on you, our team or the company
- Promoting our team, our work and the work of our members is everyone's responsibility, so sometimes it might be appropriate to use your personal account for this sort of thing (promoting blog posts, product launches, etc.) but we're not going to set quotas or write tweets for you. Do what feels right and works best for you and your followers and if you have questions of want a second opinion on anything just ask. 
- If you're responsible for managing one of the team accounts it might occasionally be more appropriate to respond to questions or engage with other Twitter users from your personal account rather than the team/project account. Again, use common sense and respond from whichever account seems most appropriate to the situation at hand.


### Twitter Lists

On the @INNnerds account:

- **[INN News Technologists](https://twitter.com/INNnerds/lists/inn-news-technologists)** - All the tech/data folks at member organizations, this is never going to be a complete list but we should add to it as we find people and try to make it as comprehensive as possible.
- **[INN Apps Teams](https://twitter.com/INNnerds/lists/inn-apps-teams)** - All of the tech/news apps/data teams at member organizations (that we know of)
- **[Projects](https://twitter.com/INNnerds/lists/projects)** - Our projects that have their own Twitter accounts, typically we'll only want to create a project account for major, ongoing projects. Otherwise the main team account should suffice.
- **[Team](https://twitter.com/INNnerds/lists/team)** - Personal accounts of all our team members

There are also some helpful lists on the @INN account, particularly the [INN on Twitter](https://twitter.com/INN/lists/inn-on-twitter) list which is a list of all the organization handles for INN member organizations.
