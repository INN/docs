**Sustainable News Organizations**

Sustainable news organizations combine technology and content with
audience and revenue development.  INN believes in doing our best to open source the knowledge, tools, and best practices that help newsrooms survive and thrive. 

**Audience Development**

Audience development is a practice of systematically assessing how and where your audience finds and connects with your work today, and making concrete, step-by-step plans to reach your goals, whether it's growing your overall audience, or increasing the depth and value of the connection to the audience you have, or both.  Click here for the approach to building your own audience development practice that INN is creating in partnership with its member news organizations. 


**Revenue Development**

The experience of many INN members shows that over-reliance on foundation funding is a serious risk to long-term viability.  Building a solid stream of earned revenue, typically through events and education, sponsorship and underwriting, and developing a base of member-donors creates long-term viability for public service news organizations.  Here, INN and its member newsrooms are beginning to create a repository of best practices as well as a systematic approach to building an earned revenue plan.
