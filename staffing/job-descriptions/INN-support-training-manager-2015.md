# Manager of Support, Training and Documentation

The [Institute for Nonprofit News](http://inn.org) (INN, formerly the Investigative News Network), a network of 100+ nonprofit news organizations, has an opening for a **full-time manager of support, training and documentation** on our technology and product team.

This person will own our support process (and, we hope, make it even more awesome), including: 
  
-  communicating with clients  
-  refining our support workflow   
-  resolving bugs and issues (plus assigning issues to a teammate when needed)  
-  writing great documentation that helps reduce our support volume in the long term.

The ideal candidate will have enough tech savvy to tackle most of the issues that come through the queue, but the focus of this position is on providing really great customer support and documentation. 

**Who are we?**

As a team, we support the work of our member organizations, many of which are small nonprofits with limited technology resources. We focus on problems that we can tackle at a network level, for example:

-  Hosting and supporting over 40 member websites using a WordPress-powered framework we've built and maintain - [http://largoproject.org](http://largoproject.org)
-  Building open source tools to support members' editorial needs with the goal of making their work look as great as any of the largest for-profit newsrooms
-  Providing technology consulting, training and resources to help increase the overall level of tech knowledge and ability across the network

You can read more about us [on our team blog](http://nerds.inn.org) and check out [our projects on GitHub](http://github.com/inn).



**Responsibilities:**

-  Lead front-line support for our member organizations and paid consulting clients (responding to questions, troubleshooting, tracking issues)
-  Perform bug fixes, theme changes, etc., in response to client requests
-  Identify, communicate and help prioritize new feature requests for our products
-  Create documentation to assist publishers with the Largo platform and other tools (this may take the form of technical documention, walkthroughs, FAQs, screencasts, etc.)
-  Manage and continuously improve our support workflow
-  Write content for newsletters, the team blog, social media, etc., to promote our projects and help organizations use the tools we build.

**Requirements:**

-  Excellent written and verbal communication skills; experience with direct client interaction and front-line support strongly preferred
-  Previous experience creating documentation (some familiarity with technical/developer documentation would be helpful)
-  Experience explaining technical concepts to non-technical users
-  Strong attention to detail and ability to implement plans with limited supervision
-  Familiarity with help desk, knowledgebase and project management tools and workflows (we use Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence)
-  Intermediate front-end design/development skills (HTML/CSS and some JavaScript)
-  Experience developing for WordPress (particularly theme development in a multisite environment) and some knowledge of PHP/MySQL
-  Familiarity with version control tools (we use git)

**Don't have every skill on the list?** We'd like to hear from you anyway. We're looking for great people who are invested in our mission and excited to learn.


This is a **full-time position with benefits**. Our compensation package is commensurate with experience and extremely competitive. We are also committed to giving our employees the tools they need to do their job and supporting their professional growth so you'll get an allowance for hardware, software, travel to conferences, etc.

Our team is distributed so **remote candidates are fine** as long as you're comfortable with that. Previous experience working remotely would be helpful. If you'd rather work with us (in the same room) we have team members in Columbus (Ohio), Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City or you could work out of INN's home office in Encino, CA.

**INN is an equal opportunity employer** and we are committed to creating a workplace where diversity is valued.
