### General Guidelines for Job Postings

All job descriptions should contain a general description of what INN (and our team in particular) is and does. We want to hire people who share our mission so we need to provide sufficient background around who we are and how we work.

Job postings should also play up some of the less tangible benefits we offer (mission focus, flexible schedule, remote working, commitment to continuing education and professional development, etc.) because these are often a huge draw for the sorts of people we want to be working with.

All job descriptions/postings must include the follow EEO language:

> INN is an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to creating a workplace where diversity is valued. In addition to federal law requirements, INN complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the company has facilities.

**Avoid a laundry list of required skills**, programming languages, etc., and instead explain what the role actually does. In some cases it will be important to list specific languages but make it clear that we understand not everyone will know how to do everything. The list represents things that will be helpful in the performance of the job but does not represent a list of absolute requirements.

**Avoid discriminatory or exclusionary language** of any kind. Use tools like [joblint](https://github.com/rowanmanning/joblint) (see also: [http://bit.ly/1CINreU](http://bit.ly/1CINreU)) to catch language that may inadvertently discourage candidates from applying.

**We are committed to diversity.** This means that:

- All jobs will be posted publicly
- We'll make sure our job postings get in front of a diverse pool of applicants through proactive outreach and building our networks 
- In some cases, we will leave a position open longer than we would like to make sure we have a diverse pool of applications to choose from

Recruiting and hiring is time consuming and expensive so we want to find people who are excited about the work we do and who will (hopefully) want to stick around for a while. Wherever possible we should be transparent about salary, job expectations, working conditions, etc., and be focused on finding a good mutual fit. Interviews are as much for the candidate as they are for us.

We will always make ourselves available to give feedback to candidates we do not select for our positions and help them understand what they can do to improve and potentially be a better fit next time.

We will also do what we can to connect people with opportunities at member organizations and make sure that we're helping our members find the best talent to fill their positions.
