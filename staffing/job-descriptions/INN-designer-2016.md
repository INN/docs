#Design Lead

The Institute for Nonprofit News (INN), a network of 110+ nonprofit news organizations, has an immediate opening for a **full-time designer** on our product and technology team.

As a team, INN works to advance new business and editorial models for public service journalism. The tech team supports many startups and small nonprofits that have limited technology resources. We also serve as a central tech community and knowledge hub for well-established newsrooms. We focus on problems that we are uniquely suited to tackle at a network level, such as:

-  Hosting and supporting 40+ members using a WordPress platform/framework we design, build and maintain [http://largoproject.org](http://largoproject.org)
-  Building open source tools to support members' editorial work
-  Providing consulting services, training and resources to help members and a select group of consulting clients

Our work is divided between our own projects advancing the sector as a whole and one-on-one consulting and support for members and clients.

You can read more about us [on our team blog](http://nerds.inn.org) and check out [our projects on github](http://github.com/inn).

The ideal candidate for this position is passionate about design and looking to put her/his skills to use tackling problems facing nonprofit news organizations.

You'll be joining an accomplished team as our design lead, but our team is highly collaborative so you'll have an opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects while continuing to learn and develop new skills.

We are flexible on exactly what this role will be and how it will fit in with the rest of the team, but here are some **desired skills and attributes** for the position (we understand you might not meet all of these but if this roughly sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you):

-  Previous professional experience in editorial design and technology
-  Strong knowledge of front-end web design/development (particularly HTML, CSS and at least some experience with JavaScript)
-  Strong design sense and a relentless focus on improving user-experience
-  Experience with rapid prototyping and an understanding of the right level of fidelity needed to clearly communicate your ideas
-  We use WordPress a lot, so some experience working with WordPress theming would be helpful
-  Commitment to openness and sharing/writing/talking about your work
-  Curiosity and the willingness to learn, adapt and teach

**Nice to have:**

-  Experience with one or more server-side programming languages (at this point we're mostly working with PHP and Python)
-  Experience working with data visualization and mapping tools
-  Photo, video, illustration or other related visual/graphic design skills

This is a **full-time position with benefits**. Our compensation package is extremely competitive and commensurate with experience. We are also committed to giving our employees the tools they need to do their job and supporting their professional growth so you'll get a generous allowance for hardware, software, travel to conferences, etc.

We are a distributed team and this is a **remote position**. Previous experience working remotely would be helpful but we'll do whatever we can to help and support your transition if this is your first remote job.

**INN is an equal opportunity employer** and we are committed to creating a workplace where diversity is valued. Persons of color, women and members of other under-represented groups in journalism, media and technology are strongly encouraged to apply.
