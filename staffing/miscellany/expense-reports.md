# Purchasing, Travel and Expense Reports

### Pre-approval

Purchase under $100 typically do not require any formal pre-approval. However, please check with your supervisor before making any purchases just to make sure the budget exists for the purchase you are making, discuss the business need, etc.

Larger purchases and travel both require pre-approval.

- **For purchases over $100** please submit this [purchase request form](https://docs.google.com/a/investigativenewsnetwork.org/forms/d/1qb9SlCjZM9KX2cDu_GNYs03sOH-w4ypZ2FChLo8wjvE/viewform)
- **For all business travel** please fill out the following [travel request form](https://docs.google.com/a/investigativenewsnetwork.org/forms/d/148i4Tf7koQE5kYEO0yMW1mWyvyp408F8bfnwLraQHqs/viewform)

Please do not make any purchases before you receive approval for your request from your supervisor.

### Personal travel, vacation, sick leave

Should be requested [through this form](https://form.jotform.com/83325123620951). Please also add any anticipated time off to the main INN calendar so the rest of the staff knows when you're planning to be out.

### Expense reporting

To be reimbursed for any purchases you make on a personal card, you will to submit receipts and an expense report. Guidance for INN employees can be found in the most-recent Employee Handbook. Here's the [link for the 2019-12-03 revision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZP3s5IP41vMSZOTGZwnJ4Ui3q8uZpGQHwk9Y0Aql9B8/edit), which was edited more recently than that date.

The most-recently-revised expense report form can be found in Google Drive at https://docs.google.com/a/investigativenewsnetwork.org/spreadsheets/d/1Oszz-4DJ0wI_cs1EDYZPBiuIzNPZoPBhZPegkFjbhvg/edit?usp=drive_web

INN Ops director Chip Potts's guidance for using the form is in a February 28, 2020 email titled "Using the Employee Reimbursement Form":

1. Please be sure to put you name and date in the areas towards the top of the form, highlighted in grey.
2. Make sure that the cells wrap to reveal all of the information you are putting in there. They are set to wrap but please make sure they are.
3. If there is any information missing in the receipts that are not on the receipt, please notate them in the notes area. An example would be say a tip not included on a receipt. For something that does not have a receipt such as a tip for a bellhop, etc., it would be good to notate that on a separate piece of paper.
4. Also please convert the completed form, into a PDF and send along with all of the other receipts.

Submit the form and your receipts to accounting@inn.org.
