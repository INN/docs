# Purchasing, Travel and Expense Reports

### Pre-approval

Purchase under $100 typically do not require any formal pre-approval. However, please check with your supervisor before making any purchases just to make sure the budget exists for the purchase you are making, discuss the business need, etc.

Larger purchases and travel both require pre-approval.

Please also add any anticipated time off to the main INN calendar so the rest of the staff knows when you're planning to be out. 

### Expense reporting

To be reimbursed for any purchases you make on a personal card, you will to submit receipts and an expense report.

The expense report form can be found in the INN shared Dropbox folder at `INN/Exmployment Docs/Expense report template_INN.xlsx`.

Once you fill out this report, submit scans of all receipts and the completed expense report through [HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com/). 

The form must be signed by both your direct supervisor and INN's CEO, so submit the form for signatures by both people and cc: accounting@inn.org to make the processing of your request as efficient as possible.

Once approved, your reimbursement will be processed the next time the accounting firm does payroll (typically the 15th and 30th of each month).
