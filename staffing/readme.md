# Staffing and Hiring

How we write job descriptions, approach recruiting, evaluate candidates and help them get started when they join our team.

### What's in here (so far):

-  [Some information](/staffing/hiring/application-process.md) on our application/interview process.
-  [A few job postings](/staffing/job-postings) from our hiring process and from member organizations.
-  [Current job descriptions](/staffing/current-job-descriptions) for the various roles on our team.
-  [Sample interview questions](/staffing/hiring/interview-questions.md) we use for screening candidates (usually with a few additional questions that are unique to each position) and [some exercises](/staffing/hiring/exercises.md) to evaluate candidates for different types of roles.
-  [Onboarding resources](/staffing/onboarding/readme.md) for new team members.
