# Design Fellowship

### Pro Publica

ProPublica is hosting a new fellowship for a creative, ambitious designer who wants to work in and learn from the daily workings of an active newsroom.

As the design Fellow, you will work at the epicenter of one of the most exciting and ambitious newsrooms in the country and develop the skills needed to conceive, plan, and execute compelling user experiences for journalism. You will gain a deep understanding of how investigative journalism stories are reported and assembled, and be exposed to some of the best journalists on the planet.

For us, the ideal Fellow will have demonstrated an aptitude for and curiosity about at least two of the following: interactive design, a discerning eye for solid user experiences, and editorial design acumen. The design Fellow will leave ProPublica with all three. It’s a great fellowship for a design student interested in working on journalistic projects, or working interactive designers looking to transition into the field. ProPublica’s mission is to change the world with our journalism, and our ideal Fellow wants to use their design skills to help accomplish that.

This is a paid fellowship based in our New York newsroom and lasts until the end of 2015. Start date is flexible; telecommuting is not an option. Send applications to david.sleight@propublica.org. Be sure to include a link to your portfolio or work you feel is most relevant.

If the above doesn’t describe you perfectly but you think you should be working at ProPublica, please get in touch anyway and tell us why you want to work with us.
