# Senior Full Stack Developer (WordPress focus)

The [Institute for Nonprofit News](https://inn.org) (INN), a network of 120+ nonprofit news organizations (learn more about them in [our member directory](https://inn.org/members)), has an immediate opening for a **Senior Full Stack Developer** on our product and technology team.

The INN network represents the broadest field of independent investigative and public service newsrooms in the U.S. The nonprofit model is growing and we believe it is particularly well-suited to supporting innovative business and editorial models for public service journalism. 

Our product and technology team supports many startups and small nonprofits with limited technology resources. We also serve a central role foster collaboration among more well-established newsrooms. The team focuses primary on problems that we are uniquely suited to tackle at a network level, such as:

-  Hosting and supporting 50+ member websites using a WordPress platform/framework we design, build and maintain [http://largoproject.org](http://largoproject.org)
-  Building open source tools to support members' editorial work
-  Providing consulting services, training and resources to help members and a select group of consulting clients

Our work is divided between our own projects advancing the sector as a whole and one-on-one consulting and support for members and clients.
