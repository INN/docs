# Account creation

**Accounts we need to create for new team members, services to add people to, etc.**

For notes on how we use these apps/tools/services, see [our list of tools](/how-we-work/tools.md).


### Google Apps

Note: You need to be an owner or have certain admin privileges in our apps account to create users and add them to groups.

**Email**

- Login to [Google Apps](http://apps.google.com) using inn.org as the primary domain.
- Go to Users > Add New, select "add a user manually" and then fill out the new user's name and email address (typically firstname@inn.org) and allow Google to set their temporary password.
- Once the account is created you will get a confirmation message that includes a link to email instructions to the new user, you'll want to do this so they have the temporary password and know how to login and set up their account.

**Groups**

- Also managed from [Google Apps](http://apps.google.com).
- There are a variety of groups setup for various projects but the main one new team members need to be added to is nerds@inn.org so they receive all of the email to the shared team account.
- To add someone to this group go to Groups > Technology > Manage users in group, add the new team member using their @INN email address and select "add as member."

**Calendar**

- We have a shared Google Calendar (INN - Technology) that all team members should be added to.
- From Google Calendar, click on the down arrow by the calendar name and select "share this calendar."
- Team members should be added using their @INN email address and the permissions will typically be "make changes to events AND manage sharing."


### Dropbox

- Team members need access to at least the [main shared INN folder](https://www.dropbox.com/work/INN%20Permanent%20Files%20Team%20Folder).
- Optionally (particularly for FT staff who need to store a lot of stuff on dropbox without maxing out their personal account) we can add them to the INN organization (Adam is the account admin and the only person able to do this, unfortunately). Note that this costs money so we'll typically only do this for FT staff and share individual folders/docs on a case-by-case basis otherwise.


### 1password

- New team members will need to purchase, download and install 1password ([https://agilebits.com/store](https://agilebits.com/store)).
- Then, they need to be added to the INN team and granted access to the INN shared vault (an account administrator needs to do this part).
- This vault contains most of the login information we share among the staff/team (for things like social media accounts, etc.).


### Slack

Note: Slack account creation can only be done by someone with Admin/Owner privileges.

- Our Slack org is [http://innorg.slack.com](http://innorg.slack.com)
- Add new account using the new team member's @inn.org email address (will send user an email invitation).
- An admin/owner should then add them to the #00-tech-team #00-inn-staff private rooms and  and any relevant project-specific rooms.
- New user will need to click on a confirmation link in the email invitation.
- And optionally they can download the slack desktop/mobile apps from the [Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads).


### GitHub

- To add a user to any of our GitHub teams they need to first create a personal GitHub account.
- Assuming you know the new team member's account, are logged into GitHub and are an administrator of the INN organization, you can go to [https://github.com/orgs/INN/teams](https://github.com/orgs/INN/teams) and select the team you want to add the user to.
- Typically we'll add all team members to the "Tech Team" team and then optionally to "Owners" (for core team members) and "Secret" for people with permission to deploy sites/apps to production.


### Bitbucket

- To add a user to any of our Bitbucket teams they need to first create a personal Bitbucket account.
- Assuming you know the new team member's account and are logged into Bitbucket, go to [https://bitbucket.org/account/user/projectlargo/groups/](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/projectlargo/groups/). There are two teams, Administrators for staff and Interns for apprentices. Enter their username in the text field under the appropriate team and click the "Add" button.


### Websites

- Typically we'll need to at least add new team members to the [team blog](http://nerds.inn.org) but they may also need access to other INN sites and/or to the Largo WP instance.
- User creation for any of these sites follows the typical WordPress multisite user creation process. Always use the person's @inn.org email address.
- Super admin privileges to the Largo instance should be granted sparingly (typically users only need access to certain sites and only certain permissions on those sites).
- For each WordPress instance a new team member is added to, they should fill out their profile as completely as possible.
- Avatars on Largo sites use [gravatar](http://gravatar.com) so new users will need to create a gravatar associated with their @inn.org email address for avatars to display properly (alternately, in newer versions of Largo, they can upload an avatar photo directly to the site by editing their user profile).


### WP Engine

- Login to [WP Engine](https://my.wpengine.com/) and click on the "users" tab at the top of the dashboard.
- From here you can add/manage users and the specific WordPress instances they have access to.
- Additionally you will need to create (for users where this is required) FTP credentials and/or grant the user access to INN Secrets GitHub repo (see above) if they need to be able to deploy.


### Harvest/Forecast

- When logged in to [Harvest](https://innnerds.harvestapp.com), click on "manage" from the top menu. You should land on the people tab.
- From here select "add person" and fill out the relevant details to invite a new user. 
- Once the account is created, go to [Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/599780/) and click on "team" in the main dropdown menu.
- Then, click "Import from Harvest" and you should see the new user you just created. Select the users you want to import and click "import people" and you should be all set.


### Asana

- Login to [Asana](https://app.asana.com).
- In the left menu you should see one or more teams. Hover over the name of the team you want to invite someone to and you'll see a gear icon appear. Click on it.
- Click on the "members" tab in the modal that appears and then click "invite more members"
- Enter the email address for the user you want to add and click "invite"

### HelloSign

- HelloSign is used for electronically signing documents.
- To create an account, you can connect HelloSign to your inn.org Google account from the [HelloSign website](https://www.hellosign.com/).

### Google Analytics

- Log into [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com).
- Click on the "Admin" tab in the horizontal navigation bar. 
- Select the account you'd like to share access to using the dropdown selector, then click "User Management".
- This should bring you to the User Management screen, which displays a list of users on the account.
- Scroll to the bottom of the page and you'll find a form that allows you to add access for additional Google Accounts.
- Enter the email address associated with a Google Account for the user you want to add, select the permissions level appropriate for the user, and click "Add".
