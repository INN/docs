# Website tasks

INN has several websites in the inn.org multisite. For each of them:

- [ ] Search for all references to your name, and update them as appropriate.
- [ ] If you're listed as a point of contact for a particular program, change that contact to either the generic contact or your successor, as appropriate.
- [ ] Edit your profile to reflect your updated status. This may include changes to your bio, checboxes to be updated, new social media handles, or other things as appropriate.
