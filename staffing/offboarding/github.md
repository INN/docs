- [ ] Is there any information you need from any of our private repos before we remove your access to them? You'll lose any private forks of those repos, too.
- [ ] Of our private repos, are there any that you own that do not have the https://github.com/orgs/INN/teams/tech-team added as admin? Make sure Tech Team has admin access. Here's a list of repos: https://github.com/settings/repositories
- [ ] Do you have privileges on non-INN repos that the person taking over from you will need. Review your organizations: https://github.com/settings/organizations
- [ ] On https://gist.github.com, are there any gists that need to be copied into INN's repos?
- [ ] Have you responded to all your assigned issues? Is it necessary to do so?
- [ ] Make sure that your GitHub account's primary email address is an account you control outside of INN.
- [ ] This is a good time to update your GitHub profile: https://github.com/settings/profile
- [ ] Remind your supervisor to set a calendar reminder to remove your GitHub account from our teams.
