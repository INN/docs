# Hardware

Do you have any physical objects that are owned by INN?
- How will you send that on to INN? How will you be reimbursed for any costs in transferring?
- Are there any accessories that need to be included with the primary object? (e.g., a charger for a laptop, the keys for the News Nerd RV)
- Are there any things that need to be done to the hardware before it leaves your possession? (Laptop sticker removal, computer wipe, oil change and gas up the RV)
