# Slack

Questions:

- What are slack channels that need to be made note of?
- What channels are you the only person in?
- What integrations are owned by your Slack user, and do they need to be edited or transferred to someone else?

And since you've got Slack open:

- Check all Slack accounts to determine which ones use your INN email address. Change accounts to use personal email addresses as appropriate.
