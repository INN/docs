Notes on how we work together as a team.

### What's in here (so far):

-  [What we've learned about working as a remote team](remote-work.md)
-  [The tools we use](tools.md) to work effectively as a team
-  [Meetings](meetings.md) - Description of our general meeting philosophy, daily scrum and weekly recap meetings
-  [Time Tracking](time-tracking.md) - Best practices for tracking your time accurately
-  [How we use Git for version control](version-control.md)
-  [Some guidelines for giving constructive feedback](feedback.md) and also how we handle performance reviews, project retrospectives and the like
-  [An outline of common project documents and how we setup new projects](project-assets.md)

### Still todo:
