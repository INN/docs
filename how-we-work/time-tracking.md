# Time Tracking 

Best practices for tracking time accurately.

### Time Tracking Philosophy

You should try to track all of your time to the best of your ability. We have projects & tasks setup in Harvest for just about everything you might need, including projects, meetings, and internal tasks. There will always be some time lost in switching between tasks, which is expected. In general, 32-35 hours logged each week is about normal for us.

### Getting Started

The fastest way to start tracking your time, is to simply login to Harvest and start tracking time there.

Alternatively, Asana has an integration with Harvest that lets you track time right from the Task view in Asana.
