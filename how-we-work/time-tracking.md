# Time Tracking 

Best practices for tracking time accurately.

### Time Tracking Philosophy

We use [Everhour](https://everhour.com) to track our time and ensure it is billed accurately to the correct project/client.

You should try to track all of your time to the best of your ability. We have projects & tasks setup in Everhour for just about everything you might need, including projects, meetings, and internal tasks. There will always be some time lost in switching between tasks, which is expected. In general, 32-35 hours logged each week is about normal for us.

### Getting Started

The fastest way to start tracking your time, is to simply login to Everhour and start tracking time there.

Alternatively, Everhour has an integration with [GitHub](https://everhour.com/integrations/github) that lets you track time right from the Task view in Asana. 

### Submitting Timesheets

Note that it is especially important to have all of your time accurately logged and submitted by the end of the calendar month so we can run invoices and make sure clients are billed accurately.
