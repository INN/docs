# Project Documents and Design Assets

Each project we work on requires a number of common documents and assets. This is a list of those items and how to use them.

### Documents

- **Project summary:** The manifesto for the project that is shared with the client ([as documented here](https://github.com/INN/docs/blob/master/how-we-work/process.md)), this serves to identify the main goals and priorities of the project.

- **Project specs:** Our internal catch-all document to keep track of credentials we may need, conversations with the client, important dates, and more. If you're not sure where to capture information for posterity (or for others on the team to find later), this is probably the place to do it.

- **Project roadmap:** Document shared with the client that describes each phase of the project, what they can expect from us, and what we need from them during each stage. This is also the document to make cut off deadlines clear (e.g., "this is the last date/stage to request feature additions").

- **Other memos:** Depending on the project, we may create other documents about topics like taxonomy, third party integrations, etc.


### Design Assets

For most projects, we will create a number of design, IA, and UX assets. Including:

- **Wireframes** — To give broad level structural framework for the project. Every page type should be mocked up.

- **A site plan or site map** — The information architecture of the site or app. Hierarchy defined, all page types identified and ordered, and taxonomy.

- **Style tiles** — Rather than creating full mockups, we prefer to create style systems for projects. It's a lighter weight way of choosing a design direction and translates better into working prototypes and code. Style tiles often include fonts, colors, and patterns specific to the project.

- **Comps or mockups** — When needed, we will create full or partial design comps for site designs.


### How to set up a project

For standard documents and assets, we will use templates as much as possible so that we're not starting from scratch with each new client. 

All of the templates live, aptly, in [the templates folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxfhnBiuyIFjfkRyc1NaQVNNbDFqczJFUmZPcEtGNUQtN0xvVFpHVzJSQ2NKN1g4Q0ZpZ0k) on Google Drive. When beginning a new client project: 

- Create a folder for the client (if one doesn't already exist) in the [shared project documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxfhnBiuyIFjfl95X0VWb3NnZ184RDRZdm1aWmJ6UUdXeDhnQkREMXVRN1JQendudVdsa2c) folder in Google Drive (you should be able to access and edit this folder while logged into Google using your @inn.org account).

- Find the templates folder and make a copy of the document(s) that you need to create and move those copies to the client folder. Edit the copied documents to add information specific to that client.

- Create a folder within the client folder for design assets (this is where style tiles, logo PNGs, and other assets will live).

- Throughout a project, if you receive any sort of contract, document, or other asset from a client, it should be copied to the project's Google Drive folder.

- If you create a new sort of document or design asset for a project that we might be able to use again, create a template and put it in the templates folder.
