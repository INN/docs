# Nerd Alert (our weekly newsletter)

Every Friday afternoon we send out an email newsletter using [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) the contents of which are also then posted on [the team blog](http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org).

The target audience should be primarily INN members (likely mostly managers and technologists), but anyone can sign up to receive it (and opt-out if they get tired of us). As with all of our public-facing communications we should write for a general audience and avoid overly technical language, jargon, etc.

### Format

Each of our team members picks one link per week, writes a couple sentences about what it is and why it matters.

We will also ask someone from outside of our team to be our guest star each week and do the same. This could be someone who works on product/tech stuff at an INN member organization, someone from elsewhere in the journalism and tech world or someone completely random. We should use this as a way to highlight people who may not be among the usual suspects but who we think has an interesting perspective to share.

We may also include (this could vary from week to week):

- Project/product announcements (but this should never be the main focus)
- Shoutouts to a project/tool/story another apps team made
- Examples of our tools in use (as a way to show interesting applications and also to thank people for using them)

And we will always end with recipes/music/other fun stuff.
