# INN Earned Revenue Development Sprints

INN and its members occasionally organize "sprints" on topics that are vital to a news organization's long-term sustainability.  Earned revenue development sprints focus on building a plan to generate earned revenue as a way of reducing dependence on foundation funding in the long term.  

**Structure** A revenue development sprint takes place over three weeks, with one hour-long meeting via Google Hangout each week.  

**Who can participate?** Anyone from a nonprofit news organization who can commit to doing the homework, attending all three sessions, and communicate with your assigned partner between sessions.  *One participant per organization, please.*  

**Pairing up** Participants work in pairs during a sprint. You'll need to save time to read and respond to your partner's plans between sessions. Because there's only one participant per organization, you will be working alongside someone from another nonprofit newsroom.  

**How Can I Find Out When A Sprint Is Happening?** INN will announce new sprints on the INNED-L listerv (for INN members), the INN newsletter, and via the @INN Twitter account. 

**What Do We Do During a Revenue Development Sprint?** a revenue development sprint is a three week process that helps participants assess their current revenue streams, expenses, and budget, set goals for earned revenue development, and create a revenue development model.

**What don't we do during a Revenue Development Sprint?**
Revenue development sprints focus on developing earned revenue through event and education series, sponsorship and underwriting, and member/donor revenue -- not grantwriting or foundation funding. 

**What will I need?** You will need a copy of your most recent financial year P&L statement, as well as your current fiscal year budget.  


# Sprint Schedule

*Week 1*  What's Your Purpose?  Before participating in the Week 1 Hangout, please fill out a Lean Canvas to describe your organization's purpose. If you have already participated in another Sprint, you may have one already.  Please review and update it.  Fill out Section 1 of your revenue development plan template (which describes the current state of your organization in terms of where your money goes and how it is spent).  

*Week 2* Strengths & Weaknesses Identify your organization's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to revenue.  Use the plan template to outline your major goals for the next three quarters.  

*Week 3* Show Your Plan You will do a five-slide presentation -- not of your plan, but of your buddy's plan. Come to this session with a complete revenue development plan.
