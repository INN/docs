# Leader Responsibilities

Like all of our recurring programs, we take turns leading the office hours. Here's what the leader for that month is responsible for:

- [ ] Make sure we're promoting the hangout and encouraging signups
- [ ] Send a reminder email the day before to make sure the people who signed up are still planning to come
- [ ] Invite anyone else at INN not on our team who might be able to help if a particular question warrants it (membership or funding questions, for example)
- [ ] Create google doc for notes
- [ ] Attend the hangout, make sure everything runs smoothly, take notes
- [ ] Edit notes and write recap blog post
- [ ] Make sure Luis and Laura know what's going on so it gets promoted via the main INN newsletters/Twitter/Facebook/etc.
- [ ] Send [feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11OkWX1K71DOYJVPVca_QRY17VrFPZ2Ok2xIxKVGQjzc/viewform?usp=send_form) link to all participants

For in person events there may be some additional responsibilities involved such as finding a venue, securing adequate pie, etc. but we'll tackle that on a case by case basis.
