# INN Websites

### What is it?

The INN website is a WordPress multisite install that contains several websites:

- [inn.org](https://inn.org) is the main INN website
- [nerds.inn.org](https://nerds.inn.org) is the tech and product team site
- [innovation.inn.org](https://innovation.inn.org) (previously journo.biz) is the website for INN's INNovation Fund. It previously also contained various blog posts and articles on general nonprofit news best practices that have now been moved to [learn.inn.org](https://learn.inn.org)
- [largo.inn.org](https://largo.inn.org) (previously largoproject.org) is the website for Largo, our WordPress platform/framework
- [learn.inn.org](https://learn.inn.org) (previously newstraining.org) contains all of INN's e-learning resources and guides
- [impaq.inn.org](https://impaq.inn.org) (previously impaqme.org) is an archived site for [Impaq.Me](/projects/apps/impaqme.md) 

This structure was adopted with the previous redesign of the site (in January 2015) to better address the various audiences that INN serves. We found, at that time, that trying to combine all of this content into one site made it nearly impossible for people to find what they're looking for.

Before that redesign, the INN homepage tried to address a number of disparate audiences (members, funders, current and prospective staff, media and even the general public). With the current design we made the main [INN.org](https://inn.org) homepage a brochure-like overview of what the organization does for people who are visiting for the first time. Then, we have landing pages for different audience types ([members](https://inn.org/for-members/), [funders](https://inn.org/for-funders/), etc.) and additional, more narrowly-targeted sites like [nerds.inn.org](https://nerds.inn.org) and [learn.inn.org](https://learn.inn.org) when there is enough content to support a full microsite.

The [INN brand system](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/recit7ea0iii5w6/AACqUkuLR0vGNHftVh-_GWEVa?dl=0) makes it easy to create additional program/project branding as needed by choosing an arrangement of the logo and a primary color for each project/subsite.

### Who made it?

The most recent iteration of the INN website was designed by Kaeti Hinck and Adam Schweigert and built by Adam Schweigert and Ryan Nagle.

The Largo website was designed and built by Gabriel Hongsdusit with assistance from Ben Keith.

Portions of learn.inn.org and innovation.inn.org were built by Cornershop Creative.
