# INN Revenue Development Sprints

INN and its members occasionally organize "sprints" on topics that are vital to a news organization's long-term sustainability.  Earned revenue development sprints focus on building a plan to generate earned revenue as a way of reducing dependence on foundation funding in the long term.  

**Structure** A revenue development sprint takes place over three weeks, with one hour-long meeting via Google Hangout each week.  

**Who can participate?** Anyone from a nonprofit news organization who can commit to doing the homework, attending all three sessions, and communicate with your assigned partner between sessions.  *One participant per organization, please.*  

**How Can I Find Out When A Sprint Is Happening?** INN will announce new sprints via the INN newsletter, and via the @INN Twitter account. 

**What Do We Do During a Revenue Development Sprint?** a revenue development sprint is a three week process that helps participants assess their current revenue streams, expenses, and budget, set goals for revenue development, and create a revenue development model.

**What don't we do during a Revenue Development Sprint?**
Revenue development sprints focus on developing earned revenue through event and education series, sponsorship and underwriting, and member/donor revenue, and foundation funding.

**What will I need?** You will need a copy of your most recent financial year P&L statement, as well as your current fiscal year budget.  


# Sprint Schedule

*Week 1*  What's Your Purpose?  Before participating in the Week 1 Hangout, please fill out a Lean Canvas to describe your organization's purpose. If you have already participated in another Sprint, you may have one already.  Please review and update it.  Fill out Section 1 of your revenue development plan template (which describes the current state of your organization in terms of where your money goes and how it is spent).  

*Week 2* Developing a Prospect List You will develop a prospect list of a minimum of 50 prospects -- grants, local foundations, underwriting and sponsorship opportunities, foundation funding, and more.  We will discuss how to build, maintain, and work a prospect list.

*Week 3* First Pitch You will pitch one person on your prospect list, and come back and tell us how it went.  Finally, you will end with a schedule and roadmap to help you develop and maintain momentum.
