#INN Sprints

INN Sprints are three week online workshops on topics of interest to INN members, such as audience development, revenue development, fundraising, and other topics. 

Participants commit to attending one weekly hour-long Google Hangout. There are homework assignments each week. Each sprint is designed to leave participants with a tangible plan of action.  Sprints can be suggested by members, and are repeated based on demand.  

The number of participants is limited, ranging from 8 to 12 participants.  While we give preference to INN members, we encourage others from nonprofit news organizations to attend.

## Audience Development Sprint

During this three-week workshop, participants build a one-page "lean canvas" style business plan, do research to establish their organization's baselines on web traffic, social media followers and referral traffic, and the performance of any email newsletters they have.  In week 3, they do a brief presentation of their audience development plan to their peers.

## Revenue Development Sprint

In this three week workshop, participants develop a prospect list and roadmap as part of a larger plan that combines foundation fundraising and activities to generate earned revenue.
