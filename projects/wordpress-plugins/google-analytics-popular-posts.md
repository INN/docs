# Google Analytics Popular Posts

### What is it?

Connects to Google Analytics and pulls metrics. Two database tables cache this data (and can be safely destroyed). A popular post widget is also registered that uses the gathered data.

This framework could in the future be used to build editorial reports, surface underperforming content, help editors understand their content, etc.

In the present incarnation, functionality is limited to providing a list of popular posts that can be displayed in a widget.
