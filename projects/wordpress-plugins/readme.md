# WordPress Plugins

In addition to our work on [Largo](/projects/largo/), our team has created a number of WordPress plugins for members and clients

### Plugins

You can find [the current list of maintained plugins at support.inn.org](https://support.inn.org/category/202-plugins-by-inn-labs).

Some plugins we have built and maintain include:

- [Pym.js Embeds](pym-shortcode.md)
- [Super Cool Ad Manager Plugin](doubleclick-for-wp.md)
- [Super Cool Ad Inserter](super-cool-ad-inserter.md)
- [Link Roundups](link-roundups.md)

Plugins which are neither maintained nor not-maintained:

- [Developer-Driven Custom Post Classes](developer-driven-custom-post-classes)

We no longer maintain these plugins, but their docs are being kept here as a historical reference:

- [Public Media Platform](public-media-platform.md)
- [News Quiz](news-quiz.md)
- [Google Analytics Popular Posts](google-analytics-popular-posts.md)
- [Term Debt Consolidator](term-debt-consolidator.md)

To add a plugin to this list, copy [`_template.md`](_template.md) into a new file.

### Utilities

- [Plugin release script](release.sh.md) (for wordpress.org plugins)
