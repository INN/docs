# WordPress Plugins

In addition to our work on [Largo](/projects/largo/), our team has created a number of WordPress plugins for members and clients

### Plugins

You can find [the current list of maintained plugins at support.inn.org](https://support.inn.org/category/202-plugins-by-inn-labs).

Some plugins we have built and maintain include:

- [Pym.js Embeds](pym-shortcode.md)
- [Super Cool Ad Manager Plugin](doubleclick-for-wp.md)

We no longer maintain these plugins, but their docs are being kept here as a historical reference:
