## What is it?

Originally developed by NPR for the Argo Project, this plugin hooks the [post_gallery](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/post_gallery/) filter to augment the output of the `[gallery]` shortcode and turn it into a slideshow.

Later incorporated into Largo at https://github.com/INN/largo/tree/trunk/lib/navis-slideshows and substantially rewritten.

## Who made it?

NPR, Adam Schweigert, and other contributors.
