# Link Roundups

### What is it?

Collect links from around the web, turn them into roundup posts and streamline the production of daily/weekly roundup newsletters using MailChimp.

### Who made it?

It's complicated.

This is one of the plugins we adopted from NPR's Project Argo but it has since been completely rewritten. See the [contributor log on GitHub](https://github.com/INN/link-roundups/graphs/contributors) for an overview of who has done what and when.

[Original repo](https://github.com/argoproject/argo-links) is here and our original fork (pre-rewrite) [is here](https://github.com/INN/argo-links).
