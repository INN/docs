# Pym Shortcode

### What is it?

Pym Shortcode will resize an iframe responsively depending on the height of its content and the width of its container. The plugin uses [Pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/), developed by the NPR Visuals Team, to allow embedded content in WordPress posts and pages using a simple shortcode.

### Who made it?

Ben Keith (originally for [Inside Energy](http://insideenergy.org/))
