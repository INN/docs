## Description:

Created for News Match 2017 to make it easy for sites to place a News Revenue Hub donation form without fighting wp_kses.

This plugin inherited some code from [okwatch-donation](https://github.com/INN/okwatch-donation) and [rivard-donation-plugin](https://github.com/INN/rivard-donation-plugin/), and superseded them.
