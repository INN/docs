# Public Media Platform

### What is it?

The [Public Media Platform](http://publicmediaplatform.org/) is a cross-media distribution system for digital content (audio, video, stories, and images). You can use it both to bring additional public media produced content to your site, and to expand the reach of your content to external web and mobile destinations.

The PMP was founded by a collaboration of APM, NPR, PBS, PRI and PRX, with the goal of bringing public media content to a wider audience.

The Public Media Platform is now [a project of NPR Digital Services](http://publicmediaplatform.org/2016/01/our-last-post-pmp-transitions-to-npr/).

INN was hired to build the official WordPress plugin for the platform.
