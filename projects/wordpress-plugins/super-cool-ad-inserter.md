# Super Cool Ad Inserter

### What is it?

This WordPress plugin gives publishers a way to insert widgets such as ads, newsletter signups, or other calls to action into posts at set intervals (after X number of paragraphs). The plugin allows a publish to set defaults (how many widget areas? how many paragraphs between widget insertions?) and then allows for settings to be overriden on a per-post basis.
