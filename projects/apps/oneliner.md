# OneLiner

### What is it?

INN [received a Knight Prototype Fund grant](http://nerds.inn.org/2016/02/22/inn-receives-knight-prototype-grant/) to build an app called One Liner to make it easier for publishers to find, evaluate and manage various third-party services.

The app has a few components:

- A research tool listing some of the most common third-party services one might add to their site along with some simple information about each, including possible performance and privacy implications. The tool will also help organizations make informed decisions and select tools that are best suited for the size of their organization and the problems they are trying to solve.
- A configuration dashboard where users can select from the list of supported services and walk through the setup process without leaving the dashboard. 
- A web service not unlike the services we’re looking to remedy. Once the user has selected and configured the third-party services they would like to use, we’ll deliver a single line of code they can add to their site. This single line of code will be responsible for loading the specified services and their configurations from the One Liner application.

One Liner is named after the “just one line of code” selling point often cited by many third-party services.
