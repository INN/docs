# Largo

### What is it?

An open source WordPress framework we built to make it easier to make websites for our members.

### Who made it?

Originally, we started from NPR's [Project Argo](https://github.com/argoproject/Argo), so kudos to them for getting the ball rolling.

The early work on Largo was done by Adam Schweigert but we've since benefitted from the contributions of everyone on the INN team and a number of [open source contributors](https://github.com/INN/Largo/graphs/contributors).

### Child Themes

- [Sample Largo child theme](https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme) for reference purposes, typically you will **not** want to clone this directly
- Child themes for all of the sites we host can be found on GitHub, usually prefixed with [`theme-`](https://github.com/INN?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=theme&type=&language=) or in an [umbrella repository](https://github.com/INN?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=umbrella-&type=&language=)'s `wp-content/themes/` folder. Umbrella repositories are used to track child themes, Largo, certain plugins, and deployment locations.

### Our hosted version of Largo (for INN members)

One benefit of INN membership (here's a full list of [what we offer to to members](/how-to-work-with-us/members-services.md)) is access to a hosted version of Largo that we maintain for a number of member sites.
