# How to Access Largo Support

Before you approach us with a Largo support request, we encourage you to consult our [User Guide](https://largo.inn.org/series/largo-user-guide/) and [knowledge base](http://support.largoproject.org/support/solutions). We work diligently to keep these up to date. If you have a general question about using WordPress, you can almost always find good answers in the WordPress Codex and Support Forums. If your issue or question pertains to a WordPress plugin we would also ask you to work with the plugin author directly rather than opening a ticket with us.

If you don’t find an answer in any of the above, the next step is to visit our [Help Desk](http://support.largoproject.org/support/home) and submit a ticket. Please include the following when submitting a new ticket:

- One topic or question per ticket
- The URL of your website and links to specific pages where you’re experiencing an issue.
- As much detail as possible about the specific issue or request. A screenshot is often very helpful. 

**For INN members and our paid consulting clients, you’ll typically hear back from us the same day** (during regular business hours). For other requests we’ll try to get back to you within 24 hours.

In our initial response we may ask you for clarification and/or share some initial suggestions and resources to address your request. If the ticket can be resolved by referring to existing resources in our Knowledge Base or WordPress documentation, we may point you there.

We will also outline next steps and if your request would require custom design/development, we’ll also provide an estimate of the time/cost involved. If you’re not already a client, we’ll also send you the necessary paperwork to move forward with the project.

Note that our work is primarily focused on improving the core Largo platform for the benefit of all of our members. This means that requests for customization or anything specific to just your organization would typically be work we would need to charge for through our consulting program. 

Thanks to the generosity of our funders, we’re able to offer INN members custom design, development and support at a reduced rate of $85/hr (from our regular rate of $175/hr). We also offer non-member nonprofits a discounted rate of $125/hr.

If you have questions about our consulting program or would like to discuss an upcoming project, email [support@largoproject.org](mailto:support@largoproject.org).

Finally, if you have more general questions about Largo, we also hold weekly open [office hours](/docs/tree/master/projects/office-hours) every Friday from 2-3 ET. You’re welcome to [sign up for a slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p-twn2D8oow7vXBfkcdYcZnVA4z8Q42OMs77KlHwf-g/edit#gid=0) and our team would be happy to try to help any way we can!
