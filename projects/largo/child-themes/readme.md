# Largo Child Themes

WordPress Child Themes inherit the files, functions, script and style of their Parent Theme.

More on how child themes work in general can be found [in the WordPress codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).

Largo is structured a specific way, and when you create a child theme it will be easiest for you to follow parallel structures as you modify and add.
