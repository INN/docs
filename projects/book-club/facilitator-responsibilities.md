# Facilitator Responsibilities

Like all of our recurring programs, we take turns leading the monthly book club meeting. Here's what the facilitator for that month is responsible for:

- [ ] Actually read the book in its entirety
- [ ] Manage the @NewsNerdBooks Twitter account for the month (guidelines are in the communications folder)
- [ ] Create the Google event and hangout
- [ ] Write discussion questions
- [ ] Create hackpad for notes
- [ ] Attend the hangout, lead the discussion, take notes (or make sure someone else is taking notes)
- [ ] Edit notes and write recap blog post
- [ ] Write blog post announcing next month's book
- [ ] Make sure INN's communications person (news@inn.org) knows what's going on so it gets promoted via the main INN newsletters/Twitter/Facebook/etc.

For in person events there may be some additional responsibilities involved such as finding a venue, securing adequate pie, etc. but we'll tackle that on a case by case basis.
