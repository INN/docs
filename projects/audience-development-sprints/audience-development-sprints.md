# INN Audience Development Sprints

INN and its members occasionally organize "sprints" on topics that are vital to a news organization's long-term sustainability.  Announcements of when a sprint is open for participants to sign up will be announced on the INNED-L email list, INN's newsletters, and on Twitter. 

**What Do We Do During An Audience Development Sprint?**
An audience development sprint is a three week process that helps participants assess their current audience, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make a concrete, step-by-step plan of action to grow traffic and engagement online. 

**What don't we do during an Audience Development Sprint?**
INN Audience Development Sprints are about digital audience development.  We don't cover broadcast, print, or other types of audience development.  

**Who can participate?**
Anyone from a nonprofit news organization who can commit to doing the homework, attending all three sessions, and communicate with your assigned partner between sessions.  One participant per organization, please. 

**What will I need?**
You will need access to your organization's Google Analytics as well as some basic metrics from your organization's social media accounts.  You'll need to know enough about Google Analytics to gather some basic data.

**Structure** An audience development sprint takes place over four weeks, with one meeting via Google Hangout each week.  

**Pairing up**  Participants work in pairs during a sprint. You'll need to save time to read and respond to your partner's plans.
